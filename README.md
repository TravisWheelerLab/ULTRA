# ULTRA
ULTRA Locates Tandemly Repetitive Areas

We use a "git flow" workflow. We have two active branches:
 * **master** will be the stable ULTRA release branch. 
 * **develop** is the ULTRA development branch


To clone your own copy of Mirage source code repository for the first time:

```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/ULTRA
   $ cd ULTRA
   $ git checkout develop
```

To contribute to ULTRA development, you want to be on the
**develop** branch, which is where we are currently integrating
feature branches. For more information, see the
[ULTRA wiki](https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/ULTRA/wiki).
